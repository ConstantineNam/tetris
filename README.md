# tetris
A scalable and responsive pure JavaScript tetris knockoff. 
Delivered in a single JS file without any libraries. 

Works well with both keyboard and on-screen controls (touch or mouse click). 
Optimized for both desktop and mobile formats.
Saves top score in your local storage, making it available even after restarting the session.

Some optional animation and styling made it bulkier than it could be if using a separate CSS sheet. Optional styling is kept separate at the bottom of the document, and can be deleted without affecting the gameplay.
