# tetris
A pure JavaScript scalable and responsive tetris knockoff. 

Saves top score in local storage, making it available after restarting session.

Some optional animation and styling made it bulkier rather than if using separate CSS sheet,
but the idea was to deliver it in a single file.

Sprites are customisable, just make sure max width remains 

Rotation function is simplified, and basically just prevents itself if there is an obstacle
on either side of the active game piece.
